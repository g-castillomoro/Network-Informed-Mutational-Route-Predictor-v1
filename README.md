# Network-Informed Mutational Route Predictor (NIMRP) v1

This is a **repository of the code created by Gaston Luca Castillo Moro**, as part of Martino et. al. (2024). Its aim is to provide a **readily-accessible tool** for researchers, even for those who may not be well-versed in coding, to apply the mechanistic model in Lind et. al. (2019) easily to their objects of study with **basic Python knowledge**, something that wasn't possible before. This is done in the spirit of spreading and **showcasing the potential of mechanistic models** for investigations on genomic architecture and predictability of adaptation/evolution, and serves as a platform for the development of novel models that expand on this one. 

Usage
------
Please, refer to `README` on `mechanistic_model` for **detailed instructions** on how to apply the model on any new pathway of interest using Python

Contents
-------

This repository includes: 
- Ready-to-use, readily-accessible Python implementation of mechanistic model in Lind et. al. (2019) for any pathway of interest. 
- Code needed to reproduce figures in Martino et. al. (2024)
